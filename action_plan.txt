# Action Plan: Enhancing Project Management System

## 1. Advanced User & Role Management
- Implement custom roles (admin, manager, employee, guest) using Django Groups or a custom role model.
- Add endpoints for role assignment and user deactivation/suspension.
- Update permissions in views and serializers to respect new roles.

## 2. Analytics & Dashboards
- Create API endpoints for project/task statistics (tasks completed, overdue, in progress, etc.).
- Integrate Django packages like `django-extensions` or use raw SQL/ORM for analytics queries.
- (Optional) Integrate a charting library (e.g., Chart.js) if you add a frontend later.

## 3. Audit Logs
- Use Django signals to log changes to critical models (Project, Task, User, Membership).
- Create an `AuditLog` model to store who did what and when.
- Add admin endpoints to view/filter audit logs.

## 4. Bulk Operations
- Add API endpoints for bulk task assignment, status updates, and user/project management.
- Use DRF's `ListSerializer` or custom actions for bulk operations.

## 5. Notifications & Reminders
- Integrate Celery + Redis for background tasks.
- Add email/SMS/Slack notifications for deadlines, assignments, and updates.
- Use Django signals to trigger notifications.

## 6. Export & Reporting
- Add endpoints to export data as CSV, Excel, or PDF (using `pandas`, `tablib`, or `reportlab`).
- Create custom report endpoints (e.g., monthly performance, project summaries).

## 7. Personal Dashboard for Employees
- Add endpoints for users to view their assigned tasks, deadlines, and project involvement.
- (Optional) Integrate with calendar APIs for deadline reminders.

## 8. Time Tracking
- Add a `TimeLog` model for users to log time spent on tasks.
- Create endpoints for logging and viewing time entries.
- Add analytics for personal and project productivity.

## 9. Task Dependencies & Subtasks
- Update `Task` model to support parent/child relationships (subtasks).
- Add dependency fields and logic to prevent starting tasks before dependencies are complete.

## 10. Commenting & Collaboration
- Enhance comments with threading, file attachments, and mentions (@user).
- Add endpoints for uploading and retrieving attachments.

## 11. General Improvements
- Add Gantt chart and Kanban board endpoints (for future frontend integration).
- Improve search/filtering (by tags, priority, due date, etc.).
- Add API versioning and documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
- Set up Docker and CI/CD for deployment and testing.

## Implementation Steps
1. Plan and design database changes (models for roles, audit logs, time tracking, etc.).
2. Update serializers, views, and permissions for new features.
3. Add new endpoints and background tasks as needed.
4. Write tests for all new features.
5. Update documentation and README.
6. Deploy and monitor new features.

This plan is modularâ€”implement features in any order based on your priorities. Let me know if you want detailed guidance or code for any specific feature!
